	<h2>Metropolis was once a place of peace and tranquility... Until a mysterious far reaching evil syndicate gained control. Not long after that was any notion of peace shattered. They had the police in their pockets and Government in their hands. The once prosperous Metropolis is now just a haven for crime and violence. In the midst of all this chaos, will you help resore order and bring justice back to these... Fierce Streets   </h2>
